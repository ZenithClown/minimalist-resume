## Motivation for Design

<p align = "justify">Most of the Modern-CV Template came in a two-column Variant of some sort, which I specifically do not like (and sometimes is also unadvised by many). Thus I came up with the idea of creating a New Template (while I was trying my hands for first time on LaTeX)!</p>

<p align = "justify">This presents a simple <i>single-column</i> traditional design CV, with some modern modifications like using external links, footer, modern fonts etc.</p>

## Usage

<p align = "justify">You are free to use my design. <b>Please don't use my personal CV Design for your own Work!</b> Let me know if you make any changes!!</p>

## Credits

<p algin = "justify">Some styling and fonts for the CV is taken from [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV). Also I would like to mention Michael DeCorte whose [Open-Source Resume Class for LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/res) inspired me while creating this design.</p>
