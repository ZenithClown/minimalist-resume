\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Management:} Driving \textit{in-house digital projects to enhance supply chain experience with forward forecasts based on norms}, market outlooks and commodity price forecasts.
    \item \textbf{Analytics Strategy:} \textit{Cost, route, time and share of business optimizations} using Linear Programming, Advanced AI and Genetic Algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Vendor Management:} Identify, evaluate and cost negotiations with vendors for monitoring SLAs and management of on-/off-site vendor resources.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Achievements :} (I) A centralized dashboard tracking \textit{performance of key raw and packaging commodity import price} with a month-on-month outlook and forward forecast. (II) Proactively \textit{worked with external vendors for price forecast} of two key raw materials, achieving \textit{an average model accuracy of 97.3\% for 12 weeks of forward forecast}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Built an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm using \textit{Self Organization Maps} (SOM or KSOFM), with a REST API back-end end (using \textit{flask}) to \textbf{Predict User Movement} and \textbf{Mitigate Coverage Issue} by placing one or multiple ODSCs to improve per-user SINR.

	\item Design and mathematical modeling of a \textit{Recurrent Neural Network Model (LSTM)} is extensively studied for replacing \textbf{Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) for Linearization of Power Amplifier (PA)} to achieve Linear Characteristics of PA.

	\item An algorithm is devised for \textbf{Pro-Active Load Balancing} by \textit{Estimation and Detection} of over-loaded cells based on TA, Delta and Neighbour Cells Measurement Parameters.

	\item Calculation of \textbf{Path Loss} and estimation of cellular network coverage. For this, an area is selected and divided into grids of $20 m^2$, and a neural network model is used to calculate coverage grid-by-grid.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Achievements :} (I) Closely worked with Network Planning Team, to Design and Automate Line of Sight Feasibility Module which \textit{drastically reduced manual field interventions, and estimation of up-front costs}. (II) Achieved \textit{an improvement of 1.3 to 1.9 dB on using SOM based Coverage Issue optimization}. (III) A \textit{ACPR -45 dBC is attainted} as per 3GPP standard specification with a mathematical LSTM model for DPD.
