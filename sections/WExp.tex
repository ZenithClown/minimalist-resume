\begin{itemize}
	\item Building an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm using \textit{Self Organization Maps} (SOM or KSOFM) to \textbf{Predict User Movement} and Mitigate Coverage Issue by placing one or multiple ODSCs to improve per-user SINR.
	
	\item Designing a \textit{Recurrent Neural Network Model} for replacing \textbf{Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) for Linearization of Power Amplifier (PA)} to achieve Linear Characteristics of PA, and minimizing the inherent 400-500 msec. delay present in DPD.
	
	\item An algorithm is devised for \textbf{Pro-Active Load Balancing} by \textit{Estimation and Detection} of over-loaded cells based on TA, Delta and Neighbour Cells Measurement Parameters.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unhealthy Cells were identified by comparing the throughput of a cell based on all the devices latched, at a given period of time, with the actual or desired throughput.
		
		\item Neighbour Information is fetched to find the sector which is not overloaded where the devices can be off-loaded.
		
		\item Based on the current parameter settings between the unhealthy site and the unloaded neighbour – parameters like A1, A2, A5-T1 and A5-T2 is calculated.
	\end{itemize}

	\item Building an algorithm for establishing \textbf{backhaul line-of-sight feasibility} between eNode-B (i.e. cells or towers, signal sending end) and ODSC (i.e. outdoor small cells, signal receiving end).
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item AMSL (Above Mean Sea Level) Values between the starting location and ending location is obtained from the Open-Source SRTM Database, and HOP-Length is incorporated into the Elevation Heights, to minimize obstacle interruptions.
		
		\item Fresnel Radius between the two points is calculated.
		
		\item Based on the above two parameters, feasibility is calculated between the originating site and its’ nearest three neighbours (i.e. the Customer Demand Point).
		
		\item The Nearest Neighbour is calculated from another module.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Achievements :} Closely worked with Network Planning Team, to Design and Automate Line of Sight Feasibility Module which drastically reduced manual field interventions, and estimation of up-front costs.
